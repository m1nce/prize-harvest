DATA COLLECTION
1. [x] Scrape data from PrizePicks to get projections.
2. [x] Use balldontlie API to get players' individual box scores for each game.
3. [x] Dump data from balldontlie to SQL using bash.
   - Create database
   - Create tables
   - Dump data into tables accordingly

Data Analysis
4. [ ] Use SQL queries to understand data.
5. [ ] Create rudimentary predictions using simple statistics for projections.

Front-End Development
6. [ ] Leverage django to create a web application showing best projections to bet 
       on, using simple probablistic modeling.
   - The key here is to make it very basic, something to actually see.

Machine Learning
7. [ ] Use various machine learning models to predict projected score.
    - Use last n number of games or complete average.
    - *Classification task
    - Can try to scrape online sources and use sentimental analysis
    - Maybe LSTM?

Front-End Development cont.
8. [ ] Implement step 7 and include machine learning model predictions.
9. [ ] Improve the basic structure - refine it.
